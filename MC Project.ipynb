One goal is to determine the  average amount of money the player has remaining after playing a fixed number of times.  In addition, we want to determine the discrete expected value when we simulate playing and show that it is close to the theoretical expected value.\n\nThe second involves using MC to estimate the amount of commission that a company expects to have to pay.  Here the sales rep's commission is based upon how close their actual sales are to their target sales.  We first want to simulate the sales for each rep and compute the total amount of commission.  Then we want to do this many times and average the total commissions from all the simulations.\n","metadata":{"cell_id":"8703378d553445c7b48064537605f53c","deepnote_app_coordinates":{"h":18,"w":12,"x":0,"y":12},"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part I - Using Monte Carlo to simulate a game of chance\n\nSuppose we have a game where there are 100 balls  with numbers 1 through 100.  The rules of the game are simple.  If you draw a ball with a number 52, 53, ... , 100 then you win; otherwise the house wins.  We can easily compute the probability of winning:\n- Player has 49 out of 100 chances of winning so probability is 0.49\n- House has 51 out of 100 chances of winning so probability is 0.51\nClearly the house has an edge which we can compute using the expected value.  If you bet $100 then the expected value is\n> expected value = (100)(0.49) - (100)(0.51) = - 0.02(100) = -2\n\nSo with this bet, you should expect to lose $2 per game.\n\nThe goal is to approximate your ending funds if you decide you are only going to play a certain number of games.  For example, suppose you are only going to play 5 times then we could simulate the game for 5 times.  However, this would only give us the remaining funds for one example of playing 5 games.  Instead we want to do this many times and average the result.\n\n__Assume that the starting funds are  10,000 dollars and we always wager 100 dollars per game.__\n","metadata":{"cell_id":"65dc71da150d4375885005f28331a504","deepnote_app_coordinates":{"h":44,"w":12,"x":0,"y":31},"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import random library and set seed\nimport random\nrandom.seed(123)","metadata":{"cell_id":"3c5357223741446992a91b6beba684a7","source_hash":"c50111a2","execution_start":1679934066850,"execution_millis":6,"deepnote_app_coordinates":{"h":5,"w":12,"x":0,"y":76},"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# function which randomly draws a ball with an integer between 1 and 100 on it;

In this case, it is simply the amount of actual sales each person might make. So we have 5 sales reps so we need 5 random numbers. Once we have a random sales amount for each rep we use the table to compute the commission rate and then compute the total commission for each rep. We do this many, many times and then average the total commissions.\n\nNow when we estimate the sales for say rep 1 (target =  150,000 dollars) we might now want to pick a random integer between 0 and 150,000. However,the sales reps are good at what they do (based on their history) so they probably won't have very few sales. So for simplicity let's assume that no one has ever sold less than 85 percent of their target value. For simplicity, let's also assume that no one sells more than 110 percent of their target value. There is a more sophisticated way to do this by assuming a particular distribution, but we will just take a uniform approach to generating the random numbers.\nThis means that for each rep we need to generate a random number between:\n\n- sales rep # 1 (target  150,000)  range: 112,500 to  165,000 dollars\n- sales rep # 2 (target  200,000)  range: 150,000 to 220,000 dollars\n- sales rep # 3 (target 95,000)   range: 71,250 to  104,500 dollars\n- sales rep # 4 (target  350,000)  range: 262,500 to 385,000 dollars\n- sales rep # 5 (target  425,000)  range: 318,750 to  467,500\n\nThese ranges are calculated by taking .85 times target sales to 1.1 times target sales. We will have Python generate these for us but for reference I added them here.\n","metadata":{"cell_id":"b92831e705df443ca1d2e12b8a5d40ae","deepnote_app_coordinates":{"h":39,"w":12,"x":0,"y":300},"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#import
